# Matlab-simulation

This repo is my collection of several experiments done with Matlab.

PS: If the Chinese comments are encoded incorrectly, because Matlab uses GBK for Chinese encoding, and Github uses UTF-8, so transform the files into UTF-8 if you want to see the comments in VSCode or Sublime Text, and you can directly see the right comments in Matlab.
